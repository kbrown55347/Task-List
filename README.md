# Task Manager

## Description
---

*Duration: 2 day sprint*

I created an application that allows a user to add tasks to a 'To Do' list. Once added, the user has the option to mark and unmark the task as completed as well as to remove the task completely from the list. 

To accomplish this, I first created an html layout with a section for adding a new task and a 'To Do' list to display all active tasks. Next, I utilized CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) to wire routes for sending information to and from the client, server and database. Lastly, I used CSS styling to move the aesthetics of the page beyond the intrinsic HTML look.
